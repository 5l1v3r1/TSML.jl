# TSML (Time Series Machine Learning)

Julia 1.0: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/IBM/TSML.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/IBM/TSML.jl)


TSML (Time Series Machine Learning) is package for Time Series data processing and prediction. It combines ML libraries from Python's ScikitLearn, R's Caret, and Julia using a common API and allows seamless ensembling and integration of heterogenous ML libraries to create complex models for robust time-series prediction.
