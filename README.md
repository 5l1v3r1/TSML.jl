TSML (Time Series Machine Learning Package) is package for Time Series data processing and prediction. It combines ML libraries from Python's ScikitLearn, R's Caret, and Julia using a common API and allows seamless ensembling and integration of heterogenous ML libraries to create complex models for robust time-series prediction.
