# TS Data Discovery

We have enough building blocks to perform data discovery given a bunch 
of time series data generated by sensors. Processing hundreds or thousands
of time series data is becoming a common occurrence and typical challenge nowadays
with the rapid adoption of IoT technology in buildings, manufacturing industries, etc.

In this section, we will use those transformers discussed in the previous sections to normalize
and extract the statistical features of TS. These extracted stat features will be used
as input to a Machine learning model. We will train this model to learn the signatures of different
TS types so that we can use it to classify unknown or unlabeled sensor data.
